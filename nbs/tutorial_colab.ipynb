    "In this tutorial we are going to complete an entire `nbdev`-based project from start to finish utilizing only [Google Colaboratory](colab.research.google.com), a free* alternative Jupyter environment with GPU capabilities. The goal is to set your project up in such a way that building, generating notebooks, testing, and setup is as seamless as possible inside their platform. \n",

    "## Why Use Google Colaboratory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colaboratory offers a few unique advantages over other platforms in regards to the capabilities you can utilize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can have synchronous programming within the same notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "    When working in a team or in a pair-programming situation, you both can have the exact same Jupyter notebook open and synchronously write comments or code within it when your project is based out of your Google Drive. Other platforms have only recently been testing this capability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Smaller projects that don't require git can still be utilized\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are certainly situations where perhaps you (or the company you work for) don't see the benefit yet in storing your code away in a repository. Simply keeping it in your Google Drive offers you this flexibility, while losing almost none of the benefits of GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. It's free*\n",
    "\n",
    "    Whether you're a student or someone who worries about your GPU credits, Google Colaboratory has a free option for you to utilize both Jupyter and GPU's without requiring a credit card to get started. Recently Google has released a [Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) option for $10/month (only for the US and Canada right now), which allows for better access to GPU's and an in-house terminal, but neither of these are truly needed to get you utilizing Colab for `nbdev` and your software engineering projects!"
