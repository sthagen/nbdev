    "- **For methods, you must call `show_doc`** for a documentation heading to appear, as illustrated in the `Card.__eq__` method above.  This is by design, since unlike functions, you typically define all of the methods for a class in a single contiguous block of code.  Therefore, `show_doc` allows you to control both the order and placement of documentation headers for methods which help you write prose and tests for each method organized under the appropriate header.\n",
